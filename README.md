GridCalc is a webapp I developed for other artists who seek the mathematically proportions that I do. The webapp overlays a grid of a desired row and column amount onto an input refrence image and then maps each point to the canvas you want to draw on. This way you can pick any point on the refrence image and the program will tell you exactly where that point lies on your canvas. Using this method one can make transferring proportions from refrence images to real canvases much easier.

To use GridCalc simply download the code and access the included app.js file. There, modify the marked lines of code with the parameters for your grid and canvas. Then, open the included index.html file in your browser to see your refrence image overlayed with the desired grid. Now, you can click on any point on the refrence image and the program will output to the console the xy coordinates of that point on your canvas relative to the nearest grid cell. 

The grid point that the xy-coordinates are relative too (treated as (0,0) origin) will change color and enlarge for clarity and all points relative to it will be of the same color.
